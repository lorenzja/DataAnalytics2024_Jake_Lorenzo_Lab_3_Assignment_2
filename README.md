Part 1 Variable Distributions

Part 2 Linear Models
The first linear model I created compared the following five variables (FSH, WRS, AIR, H20, and APO) to the LOG_EPI data. The two varibales that most signifacantly influence EPI is AIR and APO. The R-Squared value for the world data model comparing LOG_WPI and WPO was 0.5363837. The second model I created compared the same variables to LOG_EPI but narrowed the scope to only the Global West Region. The R-squared value for comparing APO and LOG_EPI was 0.2306443. Since the R-Squared value for the Global model was higher than the Global West Model I can say that the Global model was a better fit. I think this was due to the small sample size of the Global West region and since the Global model had more data points to analyze more statistically signifacant information could be extracted.
